  "PETER PAN\nHe can fly!",
  "3 LITTLE PIGS\nHe can fly!",
  "HEAD GUARD\nHe can talk!",
  "DONKEY\nHa, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm\na flying, talking donkey. You might\nhave seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly\nbut I bet you ain't never seen a donkey\nfly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins\nto wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink\nto the ground.)",

  "HEAD GUARD\nBy the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized\nto place you both under arrest and transport\nyou to a designated resettlement facility.",
  "\nSHREK\nOh, really? You and what army?",
  "He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well\nand we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail\nand runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and\nbegins walking back to his cottage.",

  "SHREK\nAre you talkin' to...(he turns around\nand Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back\naround and Donkey is right in front\nof him.) Whoa!",
  "DONKEY\nYes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell\nyou that you that you was great back\nhere? Those guards! They thought they\nwas all of that. Then you showed up,\nand bam! They was trippin' over themselves\nlike babes in the woods. That really\nmade me feel good to see that.",
  "SHREK\nOh, that's great. Really.",
  "DONKEY\nMan, it's good to be free.",
  "SHREK\nNow, why don't you go celebrate your\nfreedom with your own friends? Hmm?",
  "\nDONKEY\nBut, uh, I don't have any friends. And\nI'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey,\nwait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll\nstick with you. You're mean, green,\nfightin' machine. Together we'll scare\nthe spit out of anybody that crosses\nus.",
  "Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very\nloudly.",
  "DONKEY\nOh, wow! That was really scary. If you\ndon't mind me sayin', if that don't\nwork, your breath certainly will get\nthe job done, 'cause you definitely\nneed some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause\nyou breath stinks! You almost burned\nthe hair outta my nose, just like the\ntime...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey\ncontinues to talk, so Shrek removes\nhis hand.) ...then I ate some rotten\nberries. I had strong gases leaking\nout of my butt that day.",
  "SHREK\nWhy are you following me?",
  "DONKEY\nI'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause\nI'm all alone, There's no one here beside\nme, My problems have all gone, There's\nno one to deride me, But you gotta have\nfaith...",
  "SHREK\nStop singing! It's no wonder you don't\nhave any friends.",
  "DONKEY\nWow. Only a true friend would be that\ncruelly honest.",

  "DONKEY\n(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really\ntall?",

(They come over\na hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.)\nWhoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live\nin place like that?",
  "SHREK\nThat would be my home.",
  "DONKEY\nOh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful.\nYou know you are quite a decorator.\nIt's amazing what you've done with such\na modest budget. I like that boulder.\nThat is a nice boulder. I guess you\ndon't entertain much, do you?",
  "SHREK\nI like my privacy.",
  "DONKEY\nYou know, I do too. That's another thing\nwe have in common. Like I hate it when\nyou got somebody in your face. You've\ntrying to give them a hint, and they\nwon't leave. There's that awkward silence.\n(awkward silence) Can I stay wit' you?",
  "\nSHREK\nUh, what?",
  "DONKEY\nCan I stay wit' you, please?",

  "\nSHREK\nOkay! Okay! But one night only.",

  "\nSHREK\nWhat are you...? (Donkey hops up onto\na chair.) No! No!",
  "DONKEY\nThis is gonna be fun! We can stay up\nlate, swappin' manly stories, and in\nthe mornin' I'm makin' waffles.",
  "SHREK\nOh!",
  "DONKEY\nWhere do, uh, I sleep?",
  "SHREK\n(irritated) Outside!",
  "DONKEY\nOh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean,\nI don't know you, and you don't know\nme, so I guess outside is best, you\nknow. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek\nslams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do\nlike the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was\nborn outside. I'll just be sitting by\nmyself outside, I guess, you know. By\nmyself, outside.

  "DONKEY\n(from the window) I am outside.",

  "GORDO\nHow did you know?",
  "SHREK\nEnough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are\nyou doing in my house? (He gets bumped\nfrom behind and he drops the mice.)\nHey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves\nwith Snow White on the table.) Oh, no,\nno, no. Dead broad off the table.",

(laughs\nworriedly) (we see him up close and\nfrom a distance as Shrek sneaks into\nthe room) I don't want to rush into\na physical relationship. I'm not emotionally\nready for a commitment of, uh, this\n- - Magnitude really is the word I'm\nlooking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that\nis unwanted physical contact. Hey, what\nare you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just\nback up a little and take this one step\nat a time. We really should get to know\neach other first as friends or pen pals.\nI'm on the road a lot, but I just love\nreceiving cards - - I'd really love\nto stay, but - - Don't do that! That's\nmy tail! That's my personal tail. You're\ngonna tear it off. I don't give permission\n- - What are you gonna do with that?\nHey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No.\nNo, no, no. No! Oh!",

She opens her eyes and\nroars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto\nher head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms\na sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey\ntake off running. Very 'Matrix' style. Shrek grabs Donkey and\nthen grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her.",

As they hang upside down they look\nin horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to\nget them.

You're...\n(turns and sees Shrek fall down the\nhill and bump into Donkey) a little\nunorthodox I'll admit. But thy deed\nis great, and thy heart is pure. I am\neternally in your debt.

  "DONKEY\nAll right. Nobody move. I got a dragon\nhere, and I'm not afraid to use it.\n(The dragon roars.) I'm a donkey on\nthe edge!",
  "The dragon belches and Farquaad's crown flies out of her mouth\nand falls to the ground.",
  "DONKEY\nCelebrity marriages. They never last,\ndo they?",
  "The congregation cheers.",
  "DONKEY\nGo ahead, Shrek.",
  "SHREK\nUh, Fiona?",
  "FIONA\nYes, Shrek?",

  "...their wedding kiss. Shrek and Fiona are now married. 'I'm\na Believer' by Smashmouth is played in the background. Shrek\nand Fiona break apart and run through the crowd to their awaiting\ncarriage. Which is made of a giant onion. Fiona tosses her bouquet\nwhich both Cinderella and Snow White try to catch. But they end\nup getting into a cat fight and so the dragon catches the bouquet\ninstead. The Gingerbread man has been mended somewhat and now\nhas one leg and walks with a candy cane cane. Shrek and Fiona\nwalk off as the rest of the guests party and Donkey takes over\nsinging the song.",
